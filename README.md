# Dynamic Programming Problems: LCS & LRS

This repository contains C++ solutions for two classic dynamic programming problems:

## 1. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

- Problem: Given two strings, find the length of their longest subsequence that is common to both.  
- A subsequence is formed by deleting some (or none) characters without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.  
- If there is no common subsequence, the answer is `0`.

## 2. Longest Repeating Subsequence (LRS)

- Problem: Given a string, find the length of the longest subsequence which appears at least twice in the string.  
- The two subsequences should not have the same character at the same index in the original string.

### Language
- Implemented in **C++** using dynamic programming.

### Note
This repository is focused only on implementation. Explanations and examples are skipped to keep it concise.
